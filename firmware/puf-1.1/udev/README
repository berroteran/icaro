----------------------------------
Pierre Gaufillet, 26 feb. 2006

To be able to use a vasco device as a user on an Etch Debian system with udev :
- copy vasco.rules in /etc/udev.
- edit the product/manufacturer id in it accordingly to the devices you want to support (several lines are possible)
- link with ln -s ../vasco.rules 021_vasco.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d
- create a vasco group (addgroup vasco)
- add the appropriate users to this group (addgroup <user> <group>).
- do not forget to restart your session to ensure your new group has been taken into account.
