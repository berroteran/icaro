PUF (PIC USB Framework) is divided into 3 archives :
- puf-<release #>.tar.gz contains the bootloader and the demo device application,
- docker-<release #>.tar.gz is the flash programmer that communicate with the bootloader through USB,
- demo-<release #>.tar.gz is the host demo application.

docker and demo depend on libusb >=0.11.

PUF contains its own cross-compilation tools. A simple make
at the root will build everything, including the cross
tools in the tools folder. The bootloader is then available as 
bootloader/boot.hex and the demo device application in 
application/application.hex. Odyssey, once configured for your hardware,
can then be used to flash the bootloader with :

odyssey PIC18F4550 write bootloader.hex

You can then program your applications using docker and the
bootloader with :

docker write <application.hex>

To do so, you need either to be root, or to install the
stuff which is in the udev folder (provided you use udev,
of course ;-) . I prefer this solution : it is never
good to develop as root...

When your device is started, it stays in a neutral
configuration (#1) until it receives a SET_CONFIGURATION request
from the host. Configuration ID #2 is associated to the
flashing function, and USB configuration ID > 2 are reserved for 
the application. demo can be used to switch to the application with :

demo -c <configuration ID>

The puf-<release #>/bootloader/models folder contains 
a few UML2 diagrams describing shortly the bootloader
structure. These models can be edited using the UML 2.1 editor
of the TOPCASED project (see http://gforge.enseeiht.fr/projects/topcased-mm
and http://gforge.enseeiht.fr/projects/topcased-uml2).

The device and the bootloader can be configured in config.h and config.c.
USB configuration (including End Point callbacks) is set up in the 
usb_descriptor.[ch] files.
