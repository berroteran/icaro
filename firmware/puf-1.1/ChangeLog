PIC USB Framework (1.1)

  * Upgrade to odyssey 0.5
  * sdcc optimization flags switched on by default
  * Add timer2 related functions to libpuf
  * Move boot_iface.[hc], usb.[hc], application_iface.h, common_types.h
    and debug.h to libpuf
  * Add a periodic tasks sequencer to libpuf
  * udev rule modified to take into account any Vasco device
  * Add picon (text console through USB) to lipuf.
  * Add a components library to help building user applications
  * UML model updated (due to new release of topcased-uml editor).
  * Upgrade of automake 1.9.6 and autoconf 2.59d.
  * Upgrade to sdcc snapshot 4482 and gputils 0.13.4.
  * The bootloader now exports the intrinsic functions used by the
    compiler. The mechanism used is the same as for the other shared
    functions. To improve extensibility of the indirection table,
    its address is now 0x1c instead of 0x1fd2 (too close to segment
    limit). sdcc shared functions are : _mullong, _mulint, _gptrget1, _gptrget2,
    _gptrget3, _gptrget4, _gptrput1, _gptrput2, _gptrput3, _delay10ktcy,
    _delay1ktcy, and _delay10tcy. In the case of picon, 270 program bytes
    are saved thanks to that method (close feature request #364).    
  * The return of the SET_CONFIGURATION bug... Configuration change is now
    effective after the null IN packet aknownledgment. Include a sdcc work
    around : for(i=1;i<16;i++) was "optimized" to for(i=14;i>=0;i--). So I 
    had to change this loop to for(i=15;i>0;i--) : close bug #397 once more... 
  * Build optimization flags revisited.

 PIC USB Framework (1.0)

  * License updated to LGPL 2.1 (close bug #366)
  * Interrupts are now supported (close feature request #362)
  * Application code can now access the USB states : device, alt_setting, 
    configuration (close bug #385)
  * Configuration of the bootloader is now centralized in config.h (close bug #386)
  * Bootloader USB functions are now used by default : reflash an application
    does not crash the device anymore. Functions are switched to the 
    application ones when switching to application configuration (close
    bug #387)
  * EP0, EP1 and EP2 buffers are not anymore at fixed addresses (close bug #389)
  * DEBUG mode is now disabled by default because it makes USB communications
    unstable. Moreover, application init has also been modified to improve the USB
    stability when _DEBUG is defined, even if it does not seem sufficient (close 
    bug #397)
